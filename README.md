# 📚 Data Structure and STL

Welcome to my **Data Structure and STL** repository!  
This repo contains all my codes related to **Data Structures** and **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**.  
It’s created for learning, practice, and lab purposes as part of my **CSE coursework**.

---

## 📘 About
This repository includes various programs that help understand the **core concepts of Data Structures** and how to implement them using **C++**.  
It also covers examples using **STL containers, algorithms, and iterators** for efficient coding.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### ⚙️ STL (Standard Template Library)
- ✅ Vectors, Lists, and Deques  
- ✅ Stacks and Queues (using STL)  
- ✅ Sets and Maps (ordered & unordered)  
- ✅ Iterators and Algorithms (`sort`, `find`, `count`, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Purpose
- To practice **fundamental data structure concepts**  
- To improve **problem-solving skills** using **STL**  
- To prepare for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**
